		  <h4><strong>Personal Information</strong></h4>		  
	  </div>

			<p>I am Duane. My full name is Duane James Tanjutco. My student number is s3785672 whilst my email is s3785672@student.rmit.edu.au. I have a Filipino background as both of my parents are from Manila, Philippines.</p>

			<p>I completed Kindergarten back in the Philippines before my family moved to Australia in November 2005. I completed the rest of my education here in Melbourne, Victoria.</p>

			<p>I commenced primary school in St Leonard’s at Glen Waverely for Prep and Year 1 before moving again to Lynbrook Primary School from Year 2 to Year 4 before moving once again to another school called St Christopher’s for Year 5 and 6. I also had my first communion and confirmation here as my family is of a Catholic background.</p>

			<p>I began high school at St Peters College (West Campus) in Frankston form Year 7 to Year 10 before finally moving to Salesian College Chadstone to complete my high school in Year 11 and Year 12 and where I graduated.</p>

			<p>The predominant language back in the Philippines was Filipino, however I dropped my home language once moved to Australia. I can no longer speak Filipino however I can understand parts of it if spoken by friends and family. </p>

			<p>My brother owns two guinea pigs named Snow and Brownie, although they belong to him, they’re regarded as the family pet. We originally started with two guinea pigs named Jasper (Male) and Gatsby (Female), who bred and thus Snow (Male) and Maya (Female) were born. Few months later, they bred again and three more guinea pigs were born, Brownie and two other unnamed babies. We then chose to give away Gatsby, Maya and two of the unnamed guinea pigs to friends and relatives leaving my family and I with Jasper, Snow and Brownie. Unfortunately, Jasper passed away in September 2018, leaving us with only Snow and Brownie. </p>

			<p>Hobbies of mine include playing video games and playing tennis. My interest in video games began when a friend of mine showed me is Gameboy Advanced. This caused me to get a Nintendo DS and a Nintendo Wii. Another friend of mine showed me their Xbox 360 which sparked my interest in the Xbox console which would shape most of my video game interests in the future such as Halo, Destiny and Titanfall. </p>

		  <div class="col-md-12">
			  <p>The results of the Myers-Briggs personality, Learning Style and Big Five Personality tests tell me that I’m much more of an introverted person compared to being extroverted while also being a type of person who quietly observes others in an environment whilst avoiding coming into contact with that environment with a few exceptions such as being with friends. I like to believe that I have a wide and colourful imagination that I just simply choose to not talk about to with others. </p>

			  <p>These results for myself may affect my behavior in a team as I may end up being quieter compared to others as a member who would rather sit back and listen to what my team has to say rather than including my own thoughts. However, I would try my best to involve myself with the others in my own team for the sake of myself and the others. </p>

			  <p>When forming a team, these results may come in useful for myself as I can find people who I would be more comfortable sharing my thoughts and ideas with which can lead to me contributing more during team discussions and debates. This sort of communication would be vital when working as a team with others towards a common goal. </p>

	  	<h4><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h4>
		<p>Playing video games sparked my interest within Information Technology, notably how video games were made and the type of work that goes into making a video game. I wanted to know more on how Information Technology evolved into what it is today and how it makes up a lot of our society through our phones, the internet and of course video games. </p>
		
		<p>Notably, I was more interested in the design element of creating video games such as drawing the characters or other design aspects of a game rather than the technical side of things such as programming and level design. However, I believed that it would be more important to study the basis of Information Technology as it would benefit me more in the future. </p>
		
		<p>I chose to study at RMIT because I am told that it is a more much ‘hands on’ university in comparison to other universities such as Melbourne Uni or Monash that focused more on bookwork which I am not a personal fan of. It is also much more convenient for me to get to from where I live where it is just a single train ride away. </p>
		
		<p>In the studies of Bachelor of Information Technology, I expect to learn a bit about the history on technology and how it affects our society and how it has changed us. Additionally, I also hope to learn some basic skills such as programming in my studies that can be applied in the future as many jobs and businesses require some knowledge and expertise in this field. </p>
