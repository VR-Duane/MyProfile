		  <h4><strong>Project Idea: VeeR - An automatic 3D Model generator</strong></h4>		  
	  </div>

<p>A project idea that I have would be a special program that can convert 2D images into 3D concepts based on the detail and shape of the 2D image that could be a photograph, drawing. The amount of detail that is available within the 3D model will be based off how much information can be derived from the provided 2D image. The software will grant the capability of exporting the automatically generated 3D model into a file that may be opened within another program like Maya so it can be edited further by a user. </p>
		 
<p>This can be extremely beneficial for many industries out there whether they are designing a video game environment, or someone is designing and developing a new phone. This program can revolutionize the way things are made based on early concepts from designers. It will allow all companies around the world to envision their final product better or make it easier for concept artists to create what they want more accurately. This can be an extremely powerful tool in a world that now heavily relies on the technology for production and conceptualization.  </p>
		 
<p>This program dubbed ‘VeeR’ as a placeholder name, has the capability of scanning an existing 2D image such as a photograph, drawing or an electronically generated image and attempt to convert that image into a 3D model. For example, a picture of a landscape view with a mountain and a forest would be converted into a plane that depicts a rotatable, zoomable and editable model of the image. If the scanned image were a person or something that had humanoid characteristics, it would produce a 3D model of the person whilst the program attempts to recreate any detail that has been shown in the image. </p>
		 
<p>The program may also attempt to create a 3D visualization of a concept such as a phone or other shapes. The program attempts to generate a 3D model based off of a series of algorithms and pre-identified shapes that will generate a 3D model in accordance to specific shapes that it may identify. If there is a shape or form that the program does not identify, it will instead either insert a 2D image onto the plane alongside the other 3D models so it can be seen as part of the model from a 2D perspective or it will still attempt the 3D model by taking the original 2D image and adding depth to it along the back of the image.</p>
		 
<p>However, when a portion of an image is not able to be identified, the accuracy of its attempt at a 3D generated model vastly decreases. However, if the user so chooses, they may export the 3D-generated model into different types of files depending on the program they choose to modify it such as Maya 3D, where it will export it as a .fbx file for use in that specific program only. </p>
		 
<p>The user may also choose to modify multiple settings for the 3D model generator. These settings will allow the user to toggle them to affect the way that the 3D model is generated such as toggling a polygon limit, so it decreases the amount of processing power that is needed for a PC to properly render the model. Another setting that the user could toggle would be the amount of detail that is put into the generated model so the user can choose to add their own unique details to the model that the program would be unable to recreate. </p>
		 
<p>The user may also choose to do a ‘re-scan’ of their provided 2D image whilst changing the settings of the program so it can update the generate 3D model in real time with the changed to the settings. An example of this would be to change the density of a forest on the generated plane once the program has identified the scanned image to include a forest within it. </p>
		 
<p>For more accurate scans, the program is also capable of scanning technical drawings of buildings or objects such as plan elevations or third-angle orthogonal drawings and thus create a generated model based off the measurements of the drawings. </p>
		 
<p>For ‘VeeR’ to run to the best of its ability, it would be best for this program to be used only on the most high-end of PC’s that are capable of providing enough power for the program to generate the potential detail within the 3D generated models. By having a more powerful computer, it widens the user’s options on how they choose to have the 2D image of their choosing to be generated in terms of quality and detail, the PC should be powerful enough that it can handle high amounts of polygons on 3D models. </p>
		 
<p>Little to no skill is required to use the program as the program does most of the hard work by generating a 3D model based of an image, however further skills are needed to take advantage of some features of ‘Veer’ such as the capability to export and edit the model in another 3D Modelling software such as Maya 3D. Generally, this software is for companies or individuals who have the money to spend on the appropriate software and hardware needed on a PC that can use the program to the best of its ability. </p>
		 
<p>If ‘Veer’ becomes a successful project, it can greatly improve the efficiency in designing a product by an individual or company and allow users to explore their ideas much more as it would be much easier to gain a deeper visualization on their ideas. Furthermore, this will widen the number of individuals who will be able to share their ideas to the world and greatly improve the chances to transform abstract ideas into a reality. </p>
