		  <h4><strong>My Ideal Job</strong></h4>		  
	  </div>

			<p>This job placement is for an individual who has an interest within the animation and technology field such as 3D-Modelling or the use of technology in the modern world. Iâ€™ve always held a passion for the work that goes into different types of media in modern society such as video games, advertisements, tv-shows/movies and devices. </p>
	  
	  		<p>For my ideal job, it would require me to be knowledgeable with multiple programs on the computer such as Photoshop, Adobe Premiere and more. Experience from the design, animation and multimedia area would be vital in fulfilling this role. Design experience includes architectural knowledge and context. Animation experience includes knowledge with 3-D Modelling software such as Maya 3D. </p>
	  
	  		<p>I can confidently say I have experience in most of these fields as a student who was interested within the design industry before. Personal experiences include 3D-Modelling, texturing, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator. However, I do lack some experience with other programs such as Adobe Premiere or After Effects. Although I may know how to 3D model with Maya, Studio Max and VRAY may be less familiar for me. </p>
	  
	  		<p>To obtain these skill, qualifications and experiences would require me to possibly undertake another minor course that centers more on these design experiences. An example of this at RMIT University would be the Bachelor of Design (Digital Media) or Bachelor of Design (Animation and Interactive Media)</p>
